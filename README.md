# 3dmaps

This repo makes use of GitHub Pages to redirect requests coming from [3dmaps.fgebhart.dev](https://3dmaps.fgebhart.dev/) to the GitHub Page of this repo, which in turn redirects to my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/fgebhart3dmaps/). This approach is used because it is not possible to configure multiple different hosts for different subdomains on namecheap.

Check the contents being deployed to GitHub Pages on the branch `gh-pages`.
